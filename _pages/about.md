I am an undergraduate student deeply motivated to pursue research in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. 
_Generative Modeling_, _Human Pose Estimation_, _Video Understanding_ and _Medical Imaging_ comprise my research interests. 
I have also delivered work in Natural Language Processing tasks such as _Document Similarity_ and _Topic Modeling_.

I also organize Computer Vision Talks, it is an initiative to encourage research among undergraduate students where invited researchers present their publication and a discussion is encouraged on the same. I am actively involved in research in related domains and look forward to collaborations in the same. 

Apart from these, I also enjoy traveling solo and exploring food!
